      <h4 class="center">AGREEMENT BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND SIX CONTINENTS HOTELS, INC </h4>
      <p class="center">The Service (&ldquo;Service&rdquo;) consists of providing a wireless or high speed<br />
        internet connection to authorized users.</p>
      <p>This Service is offered to you, the customer,  conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions,  and notices contained herein. Your use of this Service constitutes your  agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices.</p>
      <h4>SECURITY OF YOUR ACCESS AND USE</h4>
      <p>Due to the nature of wireless LAN  and High Speed Internet Access networks, control of physical access to the  network cannot be ensured. In the case of wireless networks, unlike a wired  network where a physical connection is required, anyone within range of a  wireless access point can conceivably send and receive frames as well as listen  for other frames being sent, making eavesdropping and remote sniffing of  wireless LAN frames very easy. In addition, under certain circumstances, third  parties could access your computer without your permission while it is  connected to the network.</p>
      <h4>PERSONAL AND NONCOMMERCIAL USE  LIMITATION</h4>
      <p>This Service is for your personal,  noncommercial use.
